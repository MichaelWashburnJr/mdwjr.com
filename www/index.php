            <div class="panel-body">
                I am going into my 3<sup>rd</sup> year at RIT, majoring in Software Engineering.
                I'm currently working as a Course Assistant for a Math Models of Software Engineering class.
                Outside of classes, I like to work on my own projects as much as possible.  My interests
                in software range from Web Development to embedded software (Arduino's are fun!).
                You can view projects of mine <a href="./Projects">here</a>, and I would also encourage
                you to check out my <a href="https://github.com/mdw7326" target="_blank">Github Account</a>.
                Additionally, I enjoy to go hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and watch Netflix.
                If you wish to get a hold of me, visit my <a href="./Contact/">Contact page</a>.
