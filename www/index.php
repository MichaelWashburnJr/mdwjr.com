        </div>
        <div class="panel-body font-large">
            I just finished my 3<sup>rd</sup> year at RIT, as a Software Engineering major.
            This summer I will be working at Lockheed Martin as a Software Engineer Co-op.
            Outside of classes, I like to work on my own projects as much as possible.  My interests
            in software range from web development to embedded software (Arduino's are fun!).
            You can view projects of mine <a href="/blog/projects">here</a>, and I would also encourage
            you to check out my <a href="https://github.com/mdw7326" target="_blank">Github Account</a>.
            I also enjoy hunting, fishing, four-wheeling, and snowmobiling.
            If you wish to get a hold of me, please see the links below.
