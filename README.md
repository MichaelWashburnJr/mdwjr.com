==============
This is an attempt at cleaning up and organizing my original website.
Through this cleanup I intend to...
- Make the site more organized and modular on the server.
- Limit the use of Django to the Projects page where it is actually used.
  - Upgrade to Python 3 and Django 1.7
- Structure the server in a way which allows many frameworks to be used together.
